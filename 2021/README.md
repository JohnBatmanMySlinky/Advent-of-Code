# 2021.... so it begins

1) ez
2) ez
3) less ez
4) turns out two boards can be removed at once!
4) diagonals, how do they work?
5) overcomplicated. logic for diagonals would have worked fine for horizontal and vertical.
6) had to think on part 2
7) lucky guess on range to find the optimum
8) part 2 was fun to solve on paper but haneous to code
9) good ol fashion bfs on a board!
10) lotta popping here
11) took a second to realize it had to be recursive. also screwed up p2 as I forgot part1 changes my input to part2 and I start 100 cycles in. LOL
12) struggling for so long on 2019 d18 made this not so bad
13) list indexing hurts my brain sometimes
14) thanks lantern fish. also that double counting on p2 screwed with me for a while
